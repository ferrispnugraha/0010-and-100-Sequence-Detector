# 0010-and-100-Sequence-Detector

## Mission
To implement sequence detector which investigates input **w** and will produce the output **z** if:
1. **w** is **"0010"** during last 4 consecutive clock cycles, or
1. **w** is **"100"** during last 3 consecutive clock cycles.

Sequence detector should be negative-edge triggered Mealy machine with minimum number of states.
